This is the Sass stylesheets for "djangocms-admin-style" copied from the app sources version "1.1.0".

Unlike actual project Sass stylesheets, this will not compile with Compass and require "libsass" (python-libsass 0.10.1 or node libsass will do the job).

We ship these stylesheets to add a fix for Filebrowser usage in admin and possibly change admin layout for specific needs.

Warning: These sources won't be automatically updated following the app updates, this require manual intervention, be sure to use the sources from the identical app version installed.
