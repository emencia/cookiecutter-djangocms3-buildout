Enable the use of `django-crispy-forms`_ and `crispy-forms-foundation`_. 

**crispy_forms** is used to manage the HTML rendering of the forms in a finer and easier 
fashion than with the simple Django form API. 

**crispy-forms-foundation** is a supplement to implement the rendering with the structure 
(tags, styles, etc.) used in `Foundation`_.
